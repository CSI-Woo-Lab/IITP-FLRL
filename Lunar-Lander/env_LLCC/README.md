# gym-soccer

The [Soccer environment](https://github.com/LARG/HFO) is a multiagent
domain featuring continuous state and action spaces. Currently,
several tasks are supported:

## Soccer

The soccer task initializes a single offensive agent on the field and rewards +1 for scoring a goal and 0 otherwise. In order to score a goal, the agent will need to know how to approach the ball and kick towards the goal. The sparse nature of the goal reward makes this task very difficult to accomplish.

## SoccerEmptyGoal

The SoccerEmptyGoal task features a more informative reward signal than the Soccer task. As before, the objective is to score a goal. However, SoccerEmtpyGoal rewards the agent for approaching the ball and moving the ball towards the goal. These frequent rewards make the task much more accessible.

## SoccerAgainstKeeper

The objective of the SoccerAgainstKeeper task is to score against a goal keeper. The agent is rewarded for moving the ball towards the goal and for scoring a goal. The goal keeper uses a hand-coded policy developed by the Helios RoboCup team. The difficulty in this task is learning how to shoot around the goal keeper.
